This project implemetns K-means clustering to first cluster the text documents inside the dataset_3 folder into 3 different groups. Then, the project goes on to implement k-nearest neighbors to classify the unknown documents inside the unknown folder. Simply run Main.java file to execute the project.

To test more text documents, simply place those documents inside "unknown" folder inside the project and run Main.java function again.


I was a bit confused as to how to create confusion matrix with the results of kNN, as the unknown dataset of texts were unlabeled. I managed implement fuzzy kNN and output the percentages of 

Simply run the Main.java file to get all the results.
Running the project will generate the followings in the main project folder:
1. Visual representation of clusters generated by my program named "MyClusters.png"
2. Visual representation of target clusters named "TargetClusterss.png"
3. "topics.txt" that includes 7 most important the topics selected from each of the clusters.
4. "clusterMatrix.txt" that summarizes which text documents were placed in which cluster.
5. "confusionMatrix.txt" that summarizes the confusion matrix calculation done.
6. "PCA_Data_Kmeans.csv" that contains the reduced dimensionality information of the data after kMeans.
7. unknown#(1~10).png, Unknown#(1~10)Summary.txt, and UnkownPCA#(1~10).csv that visually represents the kNN results, fuzzy KNN results and pca data of unknown documents repectively.
